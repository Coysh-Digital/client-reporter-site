# Configuration

Here's how to configure Client Reporter once it's installed.

Most of it is just standard Laravel, done through your `.env` file. The bits that matter most here are your database, the cache/session/queue drivers, and the PDF renderer. I've picked defaults that work on shared hosting without any extra services: SQLite for the database, the database drivers for cache/session/queue, and dompdf for PDFs. So on a fresh install you can leave all of it alone and it'll just work.

There are a few Client Reporter-specific options in `config/client-reporter.php`, and a handful of operational settings you can change at runtime from the admin **Settings** page (those override the config defaults). Everything else is plain Laravel.

## Database

The install wizard writes your database settings for you, but you can also set them directly in `.env`. Client Reporter works with SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL.

### SQLite (default)

The simplest option, and the default — there's no server to set up. The database is just a single file at `database/database.sqlite`:

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
```

Create the file if it isn't there yet (`touch database/database.sqlite`), then run migrations. SQLite is a great fit for shared hosting and small-to-medium agencies.

### MySQL / MariaDB

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=mysql        # or: mariadb
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=client_reporter
DB_USERNAME=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### PostgreSQL

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=client_reporter
DB_USERNAME=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

After you change the connection, run `php artisan migrate`. If you're switching databases on an install that already has data, migrate the schema into the new database first — heads up, Client Reporter won't move your existing data between database engines for you.

## Cache, session and queue drivers

Out of the box these all use the **database** driver, so a fresh install doesn't need Redis, Memcached or anything else:

```dotenv
CACHE_STORE=database
SESSION_DRIVER=database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

This is what makes the single-cron shared-hosting model work. If you're on a VPS you can point any of these at Redis for lower latency:

```dotenv
CACHE_STORE=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

Redis is completely optional — the database drivers are fully supported in production, so don't feel you're missing out by not running it.

## Queue processing

Data collection and the other background work run through Laravel's queue. There are two ways to process it:

- **Scheduler-driven (default, shared-hosting friendly).** The scheduler runs `queue:work --stop-when-empty --max-time=55` every minute, draining the database queue on each tick. All it needs is the single `schedule:run` cron entry — no long-running process. This is the one I'd recommend on shared hosting.
- **Persistent worker (VPS).** Run a long-lived `php artisan queue:work` (managed by systemd/supervisor, or Laravel Horizon with Redis) for lower latency. If you go this route, remove the `queue:work` line from `routes/console.php` so jobs aren't processed twice.

See [Shared hosting](/docs/shared-hosting) for the cron setup and [when to move to a VPS](/docs/shared-hosting#when-to-move-to-a-vps).

### What runs on the queue

Everything that talks to an external service runs as a queued job rather than inside a page request: data collection (one job per connection and period, retried with backoff on transient errors, unique so a backed-up queue never stacks duplicates), report generation (the builder queues it and polls until it finishes), billing sync and favicon fetches. The scheduler's `queue:work` line drains these; a VPS running a persistent worker processes them straight away. The Activity page shows what is queued, running and failed, and a run left behind by a killed worker is closed on the next `client-reporter:collect` tick.

Collection-run history older than 90 days and all but the newest five frozen renders per report are pruned automatically; the metrics retention setting is separate and off by default.

## PDF rendering

You can export reports to PDF with one of two drivers:

| Driver | Requirements | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **dompdf** (default) | None — pure PHP | Shared hosting; zero dependencies |
| **browsershot** | Node.js + headless Chromium on the server | Pixel-perfect Tailwind fidelity on a VPS |

The default is set in `.env` and `config/client-reporter.php`:

```dotenv
CLIENT_REPORTER_PDF_DRIVER=dompdf
# Allow dompdf to load remote resources such as a logo served over http.
LARAVEL_PDF_DOMPDF_REMOTE_ENABLED=true
```

You can also switch the driver at runtime from the admin **Settings** page (`pdf_driver`, options `dompdf` or `browsershot`). The saved setting wins over the config default, so on a VPS you can flip to Browsershot without editing any files. The report views are written to render correctly under dompdf — if you're writing your own report blocks, have a look at the [Development](/docs/development#dompdf-safe-report-views) notes.

## Mail

Reports and password resets go out by email, so you'll want to configure a mailer in `.env`. The default is `log` (messages get written to the log instead of actually sent), which is fine while you're kicking the tyres but no good for delivering real reports:

```dotenv
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.your-provider.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_user
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_SCHEME=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="reports@your-agency.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

Use whatever transport your host supports (SMTP, a transactional-mail API, whatever). The from-name defaults to the application name; client-facing report emails are branded separately through the branding system.

## Client Reporter options (`config/client-reporter.php`)

A few product-specific settings live in `config/client-reporter.php`. Most have sensible defaults, and the important ones are also on the admin Settings page.

- **`version` / `repository`** — product identity, used by the admin UI and the GitHub update checker. Keep `version` in sync with tagged releases.
- **`integrations`** — the first-party integration classes bundled with the app. Third-party integrations are discovered automatically from installed Composer packages, so you rarely edit this.
- **`report_blocks`** — the core report blocks always available in the builder.
- **`collection.default_interval`** — default minutes between collections for a connection (360 = 6 hours).
- **`collection.retention_days`** — how long collected metrics/snapshots are kept (`null` = keep everything; recommended so historical reports stay accurate).
- **`connectors.timestamp_tolerance`** — replay-protection window (seconds) for signed requests from the WordPress/Craft companion plugins.
- **`pdf.driver`** — default PDF renderer (see above).
- **`reports.default_share_expiry_days`** — default expiry for public share links (`null` = no expiry).
- **`updates.enabled`** — whether to check GitHub for newer releases and notify admins. Client Reporter never updates itself; see [Updating](/docs/updating).

Relevant environment variables:

```dotenv
CLIENT_REPORTER_PDF_DRIVER=dompdf
CLIENT_REPORTER_CONNECTOR_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE=300
CLIENT_REPORTER_UPDATE_CHECK=true
```

## Retention and disk growth

Collected data accumulates. What is kept, and what trims it:

- **Metrics and snapshots** (the per-period figures and per-day series each collector writes) are kept forever unless you set **Retention** on the Settings page, in which case anything older than that many days is pruned by the daily `client-reporter:collect` run. Generated reports keep their own frozen copy of the data, so pruning never changes a report a client has already received.
- **Collection run history** (the Activity page) is pruned automatically after 90 days.
- **Report renders** — each generation freezes a render; the newest five per report are kept and older ones are removed automatically.
- **Cached favicons and uploaded logos** live in `storage/app/public/` and are small.
- **Queue and failed-job tables** are cleared as jobs complete; failed jobs stay until you retry or dismiss them from the Activity page.

An SQLite install for a few dozen sites typically stays well under 100 MB a year with retention left blank; set retention to 365–730 days if disk space matters more than long-range history.

## Report wording

The fixed words and phrases on your client-facing reports live in `config/report-language.php` (the shipped defaults) and can be reworded or translated in a git-ignored `config/report-language.local.php` that survives updates. This is covered in full under [Branding → Report wording and translation](/docs/branding#report-wording-and-translation).

## Admin Settings page

Log in as an Administrator and open **Settings** (`/settings`, requires the `manage-settings` permission) to change these at runtime without touching any config files. Whatever you save here overrides the config defaults:

![Settings](/images/settings.png)

| Setting | Meaning | Range / options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PDF driver** (`pdf_driver`) | Which renderer produces PDF exports | `dompdf` or `browsershot` |
| **Update checks** (`updates_enabled`) | Whether to check GitHub for new releases and notify admins | on / off |
| **Collection interval** (`collection_interval`) | Minutes before a connection is considered due for collection again | 15–10080 (minutes) |
| **Retention** (`collection_retention_days`) | Days of collected metrics/snapshots to keep before pruning | 1–3650, or blank for keep-forever |
| **Share-link expiry** (`default_share_expiry_days`) | Default expiry applied to new public report share links | 1–3650 days, or blank for no default expiry |

The Settings page also shows your current version, the installation date, and the latest release info from the update checker.

## Storing integration credentials

Integration credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, connector secrets) are stored encrypted in the database using your `APP_KEY`. Keep `APP_KEY` secret and back it up — if you lose it, your stored credentials can't be recovered. See [Security](/docs/security) for the details.
