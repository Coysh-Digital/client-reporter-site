# Analytics integrations

The analytics integrations pull traffic and audience data into Client Reporter so it can show up in your client reports.

Client Reporter bundles **six** analytics providers: **Google Analytics 4**, **Google Ads**, **Plausible**, **Fathom**, **Matomo** and **Umami**. Each one connects using the provider's own API and authentication method, then collects the metrics that feed the analytics blocks in a report.

The two Google providers log in with **Google OAuth**; the four privacy-focused ones use an **API key or token** (plus an instance URL for self-hosted Matomo and Umami). Any of them can be [connected once for the whole workspace](/docs/integrations#workspace-connections-connect-once) and auto-matched to your sites, or you can connect them one at a time per site.

## Google Analytics 4

- **Auth:** Google OAuth. Requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` to be configured on the installation.
- **What you need:** the numeric **GA4 property ID** (a per-site field), and a Google account with access to that property.

Connecting per site:

1. In Google Analytics, open **Admin → Property Settings** and copy the **Property ID** (a number like `123456789`).
2. Paste it into the connection form and press **Save**.
3. Click **Connect Google account** and sign in with an account that can view this property.
4. You come back connected.

In the workspace flow, you connect the Google account first, then click **Find sites** to list every GA4 property on the account - each one is auto-matched to a site by its web stream URL where it can be, and you confirm the mapping. (Properties with no web data stream get skipped, since there's no URL to match them to a site.)

## Google Ads

- **Auth:** Google OAuth (same Google credentials as GA4).
- **What you need:** the **Customer ID** (per site, shown top-right in Google Ads, e.g. `123-456-7890`) and a **Developer token** (an account-level secret from the API Center, reused across every connection).

Connecting:

1. In Google Ads, copy the account's **Customer ID** and paste it into the form.
2. Under **Tools & Settings → API Center**, copy your **Developer token** and paste it in.
3. Click **Connect Google account** and sign in with an account that can access this Google Ads account.
4. You come back connected.

Google Ads feeds the **Ads summary** block (spend, clicks, impressions and conversions) rather than the general analytics blocks.

## Plausible

- **Auth:** API key (a Stats API key).
- **What you need:** the API key (account-level), the **Site ID** (your site's domain, e.g. `example.com`, per site), and - only for self-hosted Plausible - the instance URL. Leave the URL blank for `plausible.io`.

Connecting:

1. In Plausible, open **Settings → API keys** (top-right account menu).
2. Click **+ New API key**, name it and copy the key.
3. Enter the key and your site's domain (its "Site ID") in the form, then **Connect & verify**.

## Fathom

- **Auth:** API token.
- **What you need:** the API token (account-level) and the **Site ID** (a short code like `ABCDEFG`, per site).

Connecting:

1. In Fathom, click your email (top-right) then **Settings → API**.
2. Create an **API token** and copy it.
3. Find your **Site ID** under **Settings → Sites**.
4. Paste the token and Site ID into the form, then **Connect & verify**.

## Matomo

- **Auth:** API auth token. Works with Matomo Cloud and self-hosted Matomo.
- **What you need:** your **Matomo URL** (e.g. `https://analytics.example.com`), an **auth token** (account-level), and the numeric **Site ID / idSite** (per site).

Connecting:

1. In Matomo, click the cog (Administration), then **Personal → Security**.
2. Under **Auth tokens**, click **Create new token** and copy it.
3. Find your site's numeric ID under **Websites → Manage** (the "ID" column).
4. Paste your Matomo URL, the token and the site ID into the form, then **Connect & verify**.

## Umami

- **Auth:** API key. Works with Umami Cloud and self-hosted Umami.
- **What you need:** the API key (account-level), the **Website ID** (the website's UUID, per site), and - only for self-hosted instances - the **API base URL**. Leave the base URL blank for Umami Cloud.

Connecting:

1. On Umami Cloud, open **Settings → API keys** and create a key. (Self-hosted: create an API key and set the base URL below.)
2. Open your website in Umami and copy its **Website ID** from **Settings → Websites**.
3. Paste the API key and website ID into the form, then **Connect & verify**.

## Search Console is separate

Google's *search* data (clicks, impressions, click-through rate, average position and top queries) comes from **Google Search Console**, which is its own integration in the **Search** category - not one of the analytics providers above. It also uses Google OAuth and is matched to a verified property (a URL like `https://example.com/` or a domain property like `sc-domain:example.com`). It feeds the **Search performance** report block.

## Which report blocks analytics feeds

The metrics these integrations collect are what power the analytics blocks in the report builder:

- **Analytics summary** - headline visitors, sessions and page views.
- **Analytics chart** - the trend over the reporting period.
- **Top pages** - most-visited pages.
- **Traffic sources** - where visitors came from.
- **Top countries** and **Top devices** - audience breakdowns.
- **Custom events** - provider events where available.
- **Ads summary** - Google Ads spend, clicks, impressions and conversions.

See [Reports](/docs/reports) for adding and configuring these blocks.
